Q1
Implementation of search algorithm for the most relevant ingredients from an article provided.

Cleaning of data provided in the list of ingredients and in the article.

Applying Natural Language Processing algorithms using pre-built packages to obtain the simalirities between the ingredients and the words in the article.

Finally determining the ranking of ingredients based on simalirities between the words and the frequency of the word in the article serving as a flag for importanc.

Resulting in an implementation of O(m*nÂ²),
m = Words in the cleaned article
n= List of Ingredients




Q2
O(n) implementation to determine the pattern provided.

The pattern is simply the product of all elements besides the elements at the same position.

Appropriate conditions for Zeros have been incorporated to reduce the implementation to O(n).
