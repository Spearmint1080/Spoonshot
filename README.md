Q1

Implementation of search and ranking algorithm for the most relevant ingredients from an article provided.

Cleaning of data provided in the list of ingredients and in the article.

Applying Natural Language Processing algorithms using pre-built packages such as the Natural Language Toolkit to obtain the simalirities between the ingredients and the words in the article.

Finally determining the ranking of ingredients based on similarities between the ingredients and the words in the article times the frequency of the word in the article serving as a flag for importance.

Resulting in an implementation of O(m*nÂ²),

m = Words in the cleaned article
n= List of Ingredients

Run Instructions: All necessary libraries such as nltk must be present.


Q2

O(n) implementation to determine the pattern provided.

The pattern is simply the product of all elements excluding the elements at the same position as that being determined.

Appropriate conditions for the presence of Zeros in the input have been incorporated to reduce the implementation to O(n).
